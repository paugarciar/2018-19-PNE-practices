My notes:

*client-server model*
Can be tested in the same computer
Network interface: connections in internet, each time that I create a path between computers it is called with an IP that identificates it
    IP ADDRESS SMARTPHONE AT UNIVERSITY: 10.0.45.178
    IP ADDRESS MY COMPUTER: (terminal, ifconfig or ipconfig, inet) 212.128.253.73
    IP ADDRESS TEACHER COMPUTER: 212.128.253.64

CLIENT:
-start communication and send to server
-always need a server

SERVER:
-response to requests
-doesn't need clients
-need IP address to communicate
-need port number to specify which server: in webpages is the number 80

PING REQUEST:
    (terminal, ping 8.8.8.8)
    time=3.53 ms

    (my ping 212.128.253.73)
    time=0.065 ms

    (classmate ping 212.128.253.72)
    time=0.462 ms

    (my smartphone ping 10.0.45.178)
    time=95.5 ms

URL: identifying a computer interface for humans
If we ping a webpage address the request goes to a DNS server that returns the IP
    (ping www.google.com)
    time=3.46 ms
